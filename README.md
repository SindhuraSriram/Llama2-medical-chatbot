## Overview

In the rapidly evolving field of AI, the Llama2 Medical Chatbot stands out by combining cutting-edge technologies to facilitate user interactions with medical data. By employing Llama2 and Sentence Transformers, the chatbot comprehends and generates human-like responses, ensuring users receive pertinent medical information. The integration with LangChain and Chainlit enhances the chatbot's capabilities, enabling seamless data retrieval and interaction.

## Features

- **Advanced NLP Capabilities**: Utilizes Llama2 and Sentence Transformers for superior language understanding and generation.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Employs FAISS for rapid and accurate vector searches within large datasets.
- **Interactive Interface**: Powered by Chainlit to provide a user-friendly conversational experience.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Designed to run efficiently on systems with a minimum of 16GB RAM, making it accessible for various applications.

## Architecture

The chatbot's architecture is modular, ensuring flexibility and scalability:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Processes medical documents and converts them into embeddings using Sentence Transformers.
2. **Vector Storage**: Stores embeddings in a FAISS vector database for efficient similarity searches.
3. **Query Processing**: User queries are transformed into embeddings and matched against the vector database to retrieve relevant information.
4. **Response Generation**: Llama2 generates coherent and contextually appropriate responses based on retrieved information.
5. **User Interaction**: Chainlit manages the conversational interface, facilitating seamless user interactions.

## Installation

To set up the Llama2 Medical Chatbot, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AIAnytime/Llama2-Medical-Chatbot.git
   cd Llama2-Medical-Chatbot
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Llama2 Model**:

   - Obtain the Llama2 model from Meta's official release.
   - Place the model files in the designated `models` directory within the project.

5. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add necessary configurations, such as paths to the model and database files.

## Usage

After installation, you can start the chatbot as follows:

1. **Ingest Data**:

   ```bash
   python ingest.py
   ```

   This script processes medical documents and populates the vector database.

2. **Run the Chatbot**:

   ```bash
   chainlit run main.py -w
   ```

   This command launches the chatbot interface. Access it via `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

3. **Interact with the Chatbot**:

   - Enter medical queries in the chat interface.
   - Receive detailed and accurate responses generated by the AI model.
